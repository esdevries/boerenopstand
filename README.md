## About the Project

This repository contains the source code for [boerenopstand](https://boerenopstand.itch.io/boerenopstand), a 2D game created in Unity, regarding the [Peasants' revolt](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerenopstand_(1971)) in Tubbergen back in 1971. Special thanks to Project Group 1 for all their contributions. This game is no longer being worked on.
